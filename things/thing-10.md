[Thing 10: Sharing sensitive data](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/skills/23-research-data-things/all23/thing-10)

Sharing sensitive data requires careful consideration, but it can be
done.  Find out how.

-   **Getting started:** If it’s so sensitive - how can it possibly be
    shared and published?!
-   **Learn more:** Who are the “data gatekeepers”?
-   **Challenge me:** Make me anonymous

**Thing 10 - Sharing sensitive data**

**Getting started: ** Sensitive data *can* be shared!

#### Thing 10: Sharing sensitive data

M[ajor, familiar, categories of sensitive data are
]{style="font-size: 0.98em; line-height: 1.25;"}**human data**[ (eg
health and personal data, secret or sacred practices); or
]{style="font-size: 0.98em; line-height: 1.25;"} **ecological data** [
(may place vulnerable species at
risk).]{style="font-size: 0.98em; line-height: 1.25;"}

Given the nature of this type of data, you might expect that it can’t be
shared and reused. But in many cases, it can be.

1\. **Explore** one of these examples of published sensitive data:

-   [Pregnancy and Lifestyle
    dataset](https://researchdata.ands.org.au/de-identified-dataset-reproductive-outcome/617280/)
    shows how sensitive, de-identified data can be safely and openly
    shared. Click on “Go to Data Provider” to see the actual data.
-   This [one page
    story](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/publishing-and-reusing-data/data-reuse/benefiting-womens-health)
    tells how sensitive data from the Australian Longitudinal Study of
    Women’s Health data has been successfully published for almost 20
    years.

2\. **How do you share and publish sensitive data?**

-   Scan the ANDS [sensitive
    data](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/sensitive-data/sharing-sensitive-data)
    webpage.

[![Sensitive data
tree](https://www.ands.org.au/__data/assets/image/0005/385358/sensitive-data-decision-tree.png)](https://www.ands.org.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/385309/sensitive-decision-tree.pdf)

-   **If you have time**: follow a couple of the links on the sensitive
    data page which are of particular interest to you.

**Consider:**

Imagine you are either a researcher or a participant in a health data
survey:

-   Participant: what questions might you first ask the researcher about
    intended sharing and reuse of the survey data?
-   Researcher: What responses would you need to prepare to anticipate
    participants' questions about publishing “their data for all the
    world to see”?

#### Thing 10: Sharing sensitive data

How we manage sensitive data through its lifecycle and who has a role in
ensuring sensitive data is appropriately managed and shared are critical
issues in ensuring sensitive data can be shared.

1.  **Explore** the
    [roles](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/sensitive-data/ethics-and-data-sharing "Ethics and data sharing")
    that different people in an institution can play when considering
    the ethical framework for sharing research data.
2.  Check out the landing page for the [Open Data Institute’s Data
    Ethics
    Canvas](https://theodi.org/article/data-ethics-canvas/ "Open data institute - data ethics canvas")
    and read the questions on the [data ethics
    canvas](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Uu5hPwNa4AduRRebZHY3lHekheMpslQd/view "data ethics canvas questions").

**If you have time**: Read the [user
guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MkvoAP86CwimbBD0dxySVCO0zeVOput_bu1A6kHV73M/edit),
and find out how the data ethics canvas can be used as a framework for a
discussion or workshop.

**Consider:** Try answering two of the squares in the data ethics canvas
based on a research project you a familiar with.

**Thing 10 - Sharing sensitive data**

**Challenge me:** Anonymising sensitive data

#### Thing 10: Sharing sensitive data

De-identification (also called anonymisation or confidentialisation in
some cases) is most commonly undertaken to protect the privacy of
individuals. It aims to allow data to be used by others without the
possibility of individuals being identified. Data de-identification may
also be used to protect organisations, such as businesses or other
information such as the spatial location of mineral or archaeological
findings or endangered species.

1.  Consider the different techniques required to de-identify
    quantitative and qualitative data. The UK data service has
    information on
    [anonymisation](https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/manage-data/legal-ethical/anonymisation "Anonymisation")
    of both.
2.  Explore some [tools and
    resources](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/sensitive-data/de-identifying-data "De-identifying your data")
    for practical advice on how to de-identify data.

**Consider:** What types of data are there for which de-identification
might not be needed or appropriate?
