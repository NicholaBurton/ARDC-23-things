[Thing 2: Issues in research data management]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Research data is critical to solving the big questions of our time.  So
what are some of the issues we face in managing research data?

-   **Getting started:** Watch a cartoon about what happens when a
    researcher hasn't managed their data (at all…) What could possibly
    go wrong!?
-   **Learn more:** the 5Vs about Big Data everyone must know
-   **Challenge me:** what are the issues when data is part of an eLab
    Notebook?

#### Thing 2: Issues in research data management

**Managing data for reuse**

Research data is for everyone. Governments and universities all around
Australia and the world are now encouraging researchers to better manage
their data so others can reuse it.

Research data might be critical to solving the big questions of our
time, but so much data are being lost or poorly managed.

1.   Take just a minute and browse over some ways the [Queensland
Government
Data](https://data.qld.gov.au/article/case-studies "Queensland government using data")
is being used by businesses, families, travellers, and farmers.

2.   This 4.40min
[cartoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66oNv_DJuPc "YouTube cartoon")
put together by the New York University Health Sciences Library, is
about what happens when a researcher hasn't managed their data (at all…)
What could possibly go wrong!?\
As you watch the cartoon jot down the data management mistakes which
interest or appeal you.

3.   Now, scan through the dot points in the *Consider the following*
section of the University of the Sunshine Coast's
[LibGuide](http://libguides.usc.edu.au/c.php?g=508408&p=3477838 "USC libguide - Consider the following")
which provides advice for researchers on how to manage their data.

**Consider:** how just one of the data disasters depicted in the cartoon
could have been avoided.

**How do you manage "Big Data"?**


"Big Data" is a term we're hearing with increasing frequency. Data
management for Big Data brings much complexity - citing dynamic data,
software, high volume compute, storage costs, transfer of petabytes of
data, preservation,
[provenance](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/publishing-and-reusing-data/data-provenance "Data provenance"),
and more.

**Consider:** your views on whether the concept of the 5 Vs is useful to
support better management and reuse of Big Data. If you don't think the
5 Vs is of value, is there another framework or concept model which
could be useful for exploring data management for big data?

### Challenge Me

#### Thing 2: Issues in research data management

**Digital data in eLab Notebooks**

Laboratory Notebooks are used by researchers to formally record their
research activities. As research has become increasingly digital and
collaborative the utility of traditional hard copy Laboratory Notebooks
has been challenged. Not surprisingly then, eLab Notebooks (ELN) have
emerged as an alternative, and they can be used for more than just
lab-based research.

ELNs help researchers manage their data effectively and collaboratively
during a project, making it easier to share and publish their data,
either during or after the project has ended.

**Consider:** your view on a data management issues and possible
solutions, where data is generated, stored and shared via an  open ELN.
